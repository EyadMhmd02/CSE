- time complexity: how much time does the algorithm take?
- space complexity: how much memory does the algorithm take?

- why can't we use a stopwatch?
1. programming language.
2. compiler used.
3. skill of programmer.
4. machine running the program.

- Therefore, what we need is
    a way to analyze the time complexity of an algorithm that:
1. Does not depend on an implementation in a specific programming language.
2. Does not depend on the quality of the code generated by a compiler.
3. Does not depend on the skill level of a programmer.
4. Does not depend on the speed or architecture of a specific computer system.
