### Question 1
**Q:** When it comes to design, there is only one right answer.  
**Answer:** ❌ False  
**Why:** In design, there are often multiple correct solutions. However, incorrect solutions exist when syntax is wrong or requirements aren't met.

### Question 2
**Q:** What is the purpose of the domain class model?  
**Answer:** ✅ To show everything that is important to our system in a diagram and make it explicit. It shows all connections between different real world elements.  
**Why:** The domain model captures the real-world context and its elements, focusing on understanding rather than implementation details.

---

### Question 3
**Q:** Which of the following is true with respect to system class models?  
**Answer:** ✅ None of the above  
**Why:** There is no fixed rule like one control class per use case. System modeling is flexible and context-dependent.

---

### Question 4
**Q:** How many arrows should go to the system in the level of abstraction you are supposed to use in your Sequence Diagrams?  
**Answer:** ✅ Exactly 1  
**Why:** At this abstraction level, we represent only one system request from the actor to the system.

---

### Question 5
**Q:** An Actor is someone who sends a system request.  
**Answer:** ❌ False  
**Why:** An actor is any external entity interacting with the system, even if only receiving information.

---

### Question 6
**Q:** In your level of abstraction for sequence diagrams, you should include the communication between objects in the system.  
**Answer:** ❌ False  
**Why:** At this level, we only show the actor and the system, treating internal system behavior as a black box.

---

### Question 7
**Q:** An Actor used in the Sequence Diagram should also be an Actor in the Use Case diagram and a class in the Domain class model.  
**Answer:** ✅ True  
**Why:** Consistency across diagrams is essential. An actor in sequence diagrams should appear in use cases and be modeled in the domain if relevant.
