    Is this class immutable? Answer yes/no, and justify.

    1- Yes - the constructor validates that there is no outside refeference to the data and throws an exception if there is.
    2- Yes - the member variable is set to final and the constructor makes a deep copy.
    3- No - although the member variable is set to final, the constructor does not make a deep copy.
    4- No - the constructor always throws an exception before it is able to copy the data.
    5- No - this would not even compile since there is an assignment to a final variable in the constructor.
    6- Yes - the member variable is set to final and that is sufficient.

    Suppose the list already has five elements. What code would be faster in terms of adding an element to the list?
    1-    Both are the same because they both add a node to a linked list.
