 * The following class represents a 3d shape using an array of 3dPoints. It is intended to be immutable. Assume the 3dPoint class is immutable.
 *
 * Some of these functions, by their nature, make the class mutable and should be removed completely to make it immutable.
 * Some others might make the class mutable, but it is possible to make them safe by implementing them carefully.
 * Others are mostly safe in an immutable class.
 *
 * Determine which functions should be removed, which must be carefully implemented, and which are safe.
