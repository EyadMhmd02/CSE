    What is a programming paradigm?
    A programming paradigm is a style or approach to programming, which defines a set of principles and techniques used to.

    /*
    The compiler executes the program, true or false?
    false. The compiler translates the program into machine code, which can be executed by the computer.

    /*
    Is the following statement true or false? Prolog is a functional programming language.
    false. Prolog is a logic programming language. It is based on formal logic, and uses inference rules to solve problems.

    /*
    Features of the logic paradigm include:
    - Expressing computation in terms of logic predicates.
    - Expressing computation in terms of boolean expressions.
    - Using lambda calculus.
    - Classes and objects.

    Answer:
    Expressing computation in terms of logic predicates.

    /*
    Features of the functional paradigm include:
    - Expresses computations in terms of mathematical functions.
    - Expresses computations in terms of logic predicates.
    - Polymorphism.
    - Simpler semantics.

    Answer:
    Expresses computations in terms of mathematical functions.
    Simpler semantics.

    /*
    Interpretation of a program is the direct execution of one statement at a time sequentially. True or false?

    Answer:
    True. Interpretation of a program is the direct execution of one statement at a time sequentially. The interpreter reads the program and executes it line by line. The compiler translates the program into machine code, which can be executed by the computer. The compiler is faster than the interpreter. The interpreter is slower than the compiler. The interpreter is more flexible than the compiler. The compiler is more efficient than the interpreter. The interpreter is more portable than the compiler. The compiler is more secure than the interpreter

    Features of the imperative or procedural paradigm include:
    - Classes and objects.
    - Manipulation of named data (variables).
    - Conditional statements.
    - Encapsulation.

    Answer:
    Manipulation of named data (variables).
    Conditional statements.

    Features of the object-oriented paradigm include:
    - Logic predicates.

    Classes and objects.
    Inheritance.
