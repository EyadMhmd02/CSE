<h3>*VHDL in LogicWorks 5</h3>
<p>Please note that LogicWorks does not provide a 100% implementation of the
VHDL language standard. In developing the product, we have tried to include all
the features needed to introduce the language and to create small- to
medium-scale design simulations, while keeping the cost of the product
low.&nbsp; This does mean that some VHDL models created on other systems may not
run in LogicWorks 5 without modification.&nbsp; For complete information on the
VHDL restrictions in the latest version, see the online documentation included with
the program, or refer to our web site at <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.logicworks5.com">www.logicworks5.com</A>.</font>
