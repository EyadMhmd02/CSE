Data Structures:
- Linear:
    Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue.
- Hierarchical:
    Tree.

Tree:
- stores data using NODES.

- A node has 0 or more EDGES linking it to other nodes.

- HIERARCHICAL: PARENT nodes and CHILD nodes.

- A node CAN BE BOTH a parent and a child.

- INTERNAL NODE: HAS children.

- LEAF NODE (EXTERNAL NODE): has NO children.

- Node at TOP is called ROOT, only node that has NO parent.

- PATH: contiguous EDGES connecting one node to another.

- ANCESTORS of a node: all its parents connecting it to the ROOT.

- DESCENDANTS of a node: all its children.

- SUBTREE: consists of a node and its DESCENDANTS.

- ORDERED TREE: all children of an internal node are ORDERED.

- LEVEL of a node: LENGTH of path from the node to the root. (ROOT is at level 0).

- HEIGHT of a tree: MAX level (LONGEST PATH fro m root to a leaf node).
