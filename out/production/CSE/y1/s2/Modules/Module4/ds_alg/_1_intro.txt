- A data structure is a particular "way" of storing data in memory

- An array is the simplest data structure.

- Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees

- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure written in some language that when
executed solves a problem or performs some task in a finite amount of time. Implicit in this definition
is the requirement that an algorithm must terminate.

- GIGO (Garbage-In-Garbage-Out): correctly using an algorithm with incorrect data.

- Three primary operations:
1. Add data to the structure.
2. Remove data from the structure.
3. Search the structure for specific data.
